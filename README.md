My personal portfolio website.

[danaddison.co.uk](https://danaddison.co.uk) started life as a WordPress blog site. I blogged a little bit about learning web development, but mostly strayed off-topic. It wasn't the best use of my time.

Two years later I found myself doing web dev professionally, and decided to completely rework the site as a portfolio.

It's based on my static site boilerplate **For-the-Whim**. It's hosted with Netlify, using a continuous deployment set-up from this repo.
