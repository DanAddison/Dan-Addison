This enables him to easily upload images and info about his handiwork over time via a user-friendly admin interface.',
    'These posts form an organically growing archive of projects which are sorted under categories and tags, and thus easily navigated by a visitor looking for a particular type of job. Images added to a post automatically display in a carousel slider, so users are served detailed visual evidence of Jack\'s work.'

With no content management system to provide a user-friendly interface for the family to add the exhaustive archive themselves to the finished site, I took on the task of populating the site with all of its content.',
    'We chose this approach as there are clear benefits to building a static site. The site itself is faster as there is no server-side dynamic rendering of resources. It is very secure as there is no database or CMS to breach. Hosting costs are extremely low, as the site requires minimal server support. This means that the family avoid ongoing maintenance tasks and expenses in keeping John\'s fast, responsive portfolio site up and running.'
